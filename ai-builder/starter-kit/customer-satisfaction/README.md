# AI Builder - Customer satisfaction starter kit

This document describes the *customer satisfaction* starter kit. This kit demonstrates how AI can enhance and guide your business decisions, with minimal effort and no or low coding skills required to create, publish, and use AI models.

## Overview

This document will guide you through:

* Installation of the starter kit.
* Population of the analytical entities.
* Actions to create and publish your model.
* Actions to customize Power Apps to view the model results.

## What‚Äôs in the starter kit?

The customer satisfaction starter kit includes:

* Common Data Service entities
* Sample data
* Power Automate flows
* Dataflows
* PowerApps canvas application

### Common Data Service entities

The following illustration shows the Common Data Service entities referenced in the starter kit. The illustration communicates the direct relationships between entities and the boundary that separates the entities as transactional or analytical. Parts of this diagram will be referenced throughout this document to highlight specific components of the starter kit.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![common data service entities](media/cds_entities.png "Diagram of CDS entities")

The starter kit entities listed below are identified first by their display name followed by the entity‚Äôs physical name in square brackets. See the [Appendix](#starter-kit-cds-entity-fields) for additional details.

### Transactional entities

Transactional entities are those entities that are typically needed to run the day-to-day business such as capturing business transactions (e.g. orders, payments, usage, etc.).

* **Account** [account] - This is the standard account entity that ships with CDS being leveraged for this starter kit.
* **AIB Customer Feedback** [aib_customerfeedback] - Comments customers submit regarding their experience with the seller‚Äôs business.

* **AIB Order** [aib_order] - Transactions identifying customer purchases. An order includes one or more products (offers) which are detailed in the order product entity.

* **AIB Order Product** [aib_orderproduct] - Identifies the customer‚Äôs ordered products.

  > Note: The **Product** entity is not in scope for this starter kit, therefore only the product‚Äôs identifier is included in this entity.

* **AIB Invoice** [aib_invoice] - Transaction identifying request for payment to the customer for a given order. In the sample data provided, the invoice is created one day after the ordered products are delivered.

### Analytical Entities

Analytical entities reflect a transactional entity and are constructed using the transactional entity‚Äôs data. There are two types of analytical entities, dimensions and facts.

Dimension entities represent a transactional entity. These dimension entities are not intended to contain measures but instead contain descriptive fields for the purpose to filter related entity records. These entities are primarily used as the starting place to conduct analysis.

Fact entities represent a transactional entity and related to a dimension entity. In this starter kit, these entity types contain aggregated data from their transactional counterpart that is  rolled-up to the related dimension.

In this starter kit, an entity is an analytical type (versus a transactional type) when the entity‚Äôs display name includes ‚Äòdimension‚Äô or ‚Äòfact‚Äô.

Not all business problems or opportunities are efficiently solved with the transactional entities. With analytical entities, impact to any transactional system performance can be minimized and optimally managed and as a value proposition provide inclusion of the analytical facts into transactional applications.

The starter kit uses dataflows to populate the analytical entities. The
following analytical entities are included:

* **AIB Account Dimension** [aib_account_d]

  Associated to *Account*, the purpose of this entity is to house analytical business attributes as well as anchor relationships to the analytical fact entities.

* **AIB Customer Feedback Rollup Fact** [aib_customerfeedbackrollup_f]

  Roll-up (aggregation) of *Customer Feedback* data to the Account Dimension.

* **AIB Order Rollup Fact** [aib_orderrollup_f]

  Roll-up (aggregation) of *Order* data by account and associated to the Account Dimension.

* **AIB Order Product Rollup Fact** [aib_orderproductrollup_f]

  Roll-up (aggregation) of *Order Product* data by account and associated to the Account Dimension.

* **AIB Invoice Rollup Fact** [aib_invoicerollup_f]

  Roll-up (aggregation) of *Invoice* data by account and associated to the Account Dimension.

## Business scenario

Bob, Contoso‚Äôs marketing director, is planning a new campaign that target offers
to customers based on their level of happiness.

Inside Contoso‚Äôs business data, a field does not exist that shows the customer‚Äôs
current mood.

To meet his need, Bob takes the following steps that will provide the answer to
his business question.

Bob‚Äôs first task is to create a new field, labeling it **Is Happy Customer**, to
store the answer to his question and assigns the values:

| **Value**      | **Meaning**                                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yes            | Customer is happy (üòä)                                        |
| No             | Customer is not happy (‚òπ)                                    |
| Neutral        | Customer is between happy and not happy (üòê)                  |
| Not Determined | Default assignment until customer‚Äôs happiness is calculated. |

Bob considered adding this new field to the Account entity, but being mindful
not to cause any negative impact to the transactional systems, decides to create
a new entity, *Account Dimension*, an analytical entity type, to store **Is
Happy Customer**.

#### Progression goals

1. Create new field: **Is Happy Customer**
1. Define valid values: üòä‚òπüòê
1. Create field‚Äôs target entity: *Account Dimension*

Bob wants to use AI Builder to build a model to predict the customer‚Äôs happiness state, and update the **Is Happy Customer** field with the information. But the
prerequisite to create any prediction model is to provide labeled values,
examples, to train the model. Therefore, Bob will need to update enough **Is
Happy Customer** values (from the default value: *Not Determined* ) required to train
the model.

Knowing the business data, Bob thinks the comments in the *Customer Feedback* is
the best source to understand the heartbeat of Contoso‚Äôs customers. The
*Customer Feedback* contains thousands of comments yet no indication informing
the mood of any given comment.

This is where Bob incorporates AI Builder‚Äôs sentiment analysis into a Power
Automate flow to calculate each feedback‚Äôs overall sentiment.

> [!NOTE] Look at the **AIB Execute Sentiment Analysis Feedback** Power Automate flow to see how Bob created the logic that executes sentiment analysis over the *Subject* and *Feedback* text, resulting in positive, neutral, and negative scores to produce an average score of each. The average scores are put in the calculated field, **Overall Sentiment**, to arrive at a final sentiment. See [Customer Feedback Overall Sentiment ‚Äì Field Calculation](#customer-feedback-overall-sentiment-field-calculation) for formula details.

The following diagram illustrates Bob‚Äôs current progression:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Bob's progression - first diagram](media/bobs-progression.png "First diagram of Bob's progression so far")

> **Progression goals**

1. Identify labeled data source: Customer Feedback
2. Fix data: Apply AIB sentiment analysis.
3. Fix data: Calculate **Overall Sentiment** [1.0\|0.5\|0.0]

Now that each feedback has been scored with an overall sentiment weight, Bob
creates another analytical entity, *Customer Feedback Rollup Fact* and adds a
relation to the *Account Dimension*. This entity will store aggregation results
applied to selected *Customer Feedback* fields. He creates a dataflow[^2] to
populate the *Customer Feedback Rollup Fact* with aggregated measures one of
which is **Average Sentiment** calculated by summing the *Customer Feedback*
**Overall Sentiment** then dividing the that result by the count of total
*Customer Feedback* rows grouped by account.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Look at the **AIB Populate Customer Feedback Rollup Fact** dataflow to see how Bob populated the Customer Feedback Rollup Fact entity.With the *Customer Feedback Rollup Fact* populated, using the **Average Sentiment**, Bob creates a *Power Automate* flow to calculate and update each related account‚Äôs **Is Happy Customer** with **Yes**, **No**, or **Neutral**.
>
> * Look at the **AIB Update Account Dimension With Analytical Entities** *PowerAutomate* flow to see how Bob updated the *Account Dimension* *Is Happy Customer**.
>
> * The calculation to determine where each customer is classified was made after inspecting the Average Sentiment distribution. As a maker, if using your own business data, consider modifying these thresholds based on the distribution within your environment.

The following diagram illustrates Bob‚Äôs current progression:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Bob's progression - second diagram](media/bobs-progression2.png "Second diagram of Bob's progression so far")

> **Progression goals**

1. Create *Customer Feedback Rollup Fact* analytical entity
2. Aggregate *Customer Feedback* to *Customer Feedback Rollup Fact*
3. Update **Is Happy Customer**: (*Yes*, *No*, *Neutral*)

At this point in Bob‚Äôs journey he has a field, **Is Happy Customer,** populated
with labeled values therefore can use the field to predict any *Not Determined*
values.

Another prerequisite to build a prediction model is to identify the input fields to train the model. Bob recognizes he will need to provide fields that cover all customers: *Accounts*. This field will include customers who provided feedback.
<!-- Verify the above -->

Bob chooses a small set of transactional entities, *Order*, *Order Product*, and
*Invoice* as the initial source of input fields to train his model. Again, being
mindful to minimize any negative impact to the transactional system, and
recognizing he only wants specific measures from each entity, Bob creates three
new analytical entities, adding a relation from each to the *Account Dimension*,
to store aggregate values calculated from their respective transactional entity.
Each new entity, *Order Rollup Fact*, *Order Product Rollup Fact*, and *Invoice
Rollup Fact* are populated by their own dataflow.

> [!NOTE]
> Look at the **AIB Populate Order Rollup Fact**, **AIB Populate Order Product Fact**, and **AIB Populate Invoice Rollup Fact** dataflows to see how each fact entity‚Äôs measures were populated.

The following diagram illustrates Bob‚Äôs current progression:

> **Progression Goals**

1. Create *Customer Feedback Rollup Fact* analytical entity
1. Aggregate *Customer Feedback* to *Customer Feedback Rollup Fact*
1. Update **Is Happy Customer** (*Yes*, *No*, *Neutral*)

At this point in Bob‚Äôs journey he has a field, **Is Happy Customer,** populated
with labeled values therefore can use the field to predict any *Not Determined*
values.

Another prerequisite to build a prediction model is to identify the input fields
to train the model. Bob recognizes he will need to provide fields that cover all
customers, *Accounts*, that also include customers who provided feedback.

Bob chooses a small set of transactional entities, *Order*, *Order Product*, and
*Invoice* as the initial source of input fields to train his model. Again, being
mindful to minimize any negative impact to the transactional system, and
recognizing he only wants specific measures from each entity, Bob creates three
new analytical entities, adding a relation from each to the *Account Dimension*,
to store aggregate values calculated from their respective transactional entity.
Each new entity, *Order Rollup Fact*, *Order Product Rollup Fact*, and *Invoice
Rollup Fact* are populated by their own dataflow.

> [!NOTE]
> Look at the **AIB Populate Order Rollup Fact**, **AIB Populate Order Product Fact**, and **AIB Populate Invoice Rollup Fact** dataflows to see how each fact entity‚Äôs measures were populated.

The following diagram illustrates Bob‚Äôs current progression:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Bob's progression - fourth diagram](media/bobs-progression4.png "fourth diagram of Bob's progression so far")

> **Progression goals**

1. Create Transactional Analytical Fact entities
2. Aggregate (‚àë) Transaction entity‚Äôs measures

Now Bob is ready to build his model and refers to [build a prediction
model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/prediction-create-model) to guide his decisions and provide additional insights when building a prediction model.

The following describes Bob‚Äôs steps to build his model.

![Step 1](media/c20efb9523cf729e0b786select-outcome9196913974a.jpg "step 1: select outcome) 

After selecting **Prediction** on the  AI Builder Build page, Bob enters the model
name, *Is Happy Customer*, choosing the same name as the field he created the
label values then clicks *Create*.

![Create entity](media/create-entity.jpg "create entity screen")

In the next window, Bob is prompted to identify the field containing the labeled
values to predict. Bob chooses *Account Dimension* entity and the *Is Happy
Customer* field after which its *option set* values are presented where Bob
*unchecks Not Determined (the value he wants the model to predict as either Yes,
No, or Neutral)* and verifies the other fields (*Yes*, *No*, *Neutral*) are
checked then selects *Next*.

> [!NOTE]
> When a labeled field has more than two values (empty or null values do not count), the Maker is building a multiclassification model that is expected to be able to predict more than two values. Conversely, if the labeled field had only two values, the Maker is building a binary model that is expected to predict one of the two values (e.g. True or False). At this part of building the model, when presented multiple (more than two) values to predict, the Maker may choose to switch to build a binary model by selecting the Manage Outcomes located above the **What do you want to predict?** header. The Maker must be mindful when making this decision because the Maker will be required to choose which labeled fields are to be assigned *Yes*, *No*, *Ignore*, and to *Predict*.

![Review historical data](media/review-data.jpg "Review your historical outcome's data screen")

In the next page, Bob is asked to select the fields that will influence the prediction. Because the field he chose to predict existed in *Account Dimension*, he is presented that entity as well as all the Account Dimension‚Äôs related source entities.

> [!NOTE]
>These are recognized as the Lookup fields in Account Dimension, which is all the entities it is direct connected as shown in the [CDS Entities](#common-data-service-entities) entity diagram.

Bob‚Äôs reasoning when choosing fields is as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> See [Guide to Choosing Features](#guide-to-choosing-features) for additional insights.

| **Entity**                    | **Reasoning**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Account Dimension             | In the current scope, Bob only has one field, the **Is Happy Customer**, which is the field to be predicted. While others may show, these are not business-related fields and therefore would not add value to train his model.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Account                       | Bob wanted to avoid using any transactional entities, including the *Account* to be mindful not to cause any negative impact to the transaction systems. The *Account* may be a good source to train a model using for example the geo related fields. In the future, Bob can easily add *Account* specific fields to the *Account Dimension* and either retrain his model or create another version to compare the results. |
| Customer Feedback Rollup Fact | Would cause ‚ÄúLeakage‚Äù if the model is trained from data that wouldn‚Äôt (or shouldn‚Äôt) be available. This data was used to create label values and therefore would cause the model to look better than it really is.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Order Rollup Fact             | Like all of the analytical fact entities, Bob does not know which measure fields provide the most influence to create a prediction, therefore he chooses all the fields, relying on AI Builder‚Äôs Featurizer (an internal module) to drop corelated fields before training and then see which of the remaining fields made the *Most Influential data* list when trained.                                                     |
| Order Product Rollup Fact     | Same decision as decision noted in Order Rollup Fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Invoice Rollup Fact           | Same decision as decision noted in Order Rollup Fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Based on his reasoning, Bob unchecks the *Account Dimension*‚Äôs, the *Account* fields, and the *Customer Feedback Rollup Fact*‚Äôs fields. Not knowing which fields to
choose from the remaining analytical entities, he chooses all the fields located
in the *Order Rollup Fact*, *Order Product Rollup Fact*, and *Invoice Rollup
Fact* entities then selects *Next*.

![Focus your model](media/focus-model.jpg "Focus your model with filters screen")


Bob clicks **Next**, accepting the default to skip the step to **Focus your model
with filters**.

![Model summary screen](media/model-summary.jpg "Model summary screen")

On the *Model Summary* page, Bob verifies his choices and after confirming
they are correct clicks *Train‚Ä¶*

![Model training](media/training-screen.jpg "Your model is training message")

This triggers a message stating, ‚ÄúYour mode is training‚Äù, and that he can close
the window.

Bob closes the page.

![AI Builder Models](media/models-screen.png "Models screen in AI Builder")


![Model details](media/model-details.png "Model details screen in AI Builder")


Bob opens the *AI Builder Models* page and locates his model, *Is Happy
Customer*. When it shows *Trained*, Bob opens the model.

Not expecting an acceptable model on his first attempt, Bob is surprised that
the model‚Äôs performance received a *C* grade with 55% prediction accuracy and
when he opens ‚ÄúSee details‚Äù it shows the score in the middle range of C. Wanting
to improve the performance, Bob reviews the *Most influential data* as a
guideline to see which fields he should consider out of the original large
number of input fields to retrain his model.

Bob selects *Edit model* to narrow the set of fields to train the
model.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Another option is to keep the existing trained model and instead build another model, with a different name, that then can be compared to the previous  model(s) to assist when choosing fields and targeting the best model.
>
> * To produce this model, it required a few intermediate experiments. While it is AI Builder‚Äôs goal to produce the best model on the first training, knowing meaning of your business may provide improved results.

![Model details page for this model](media/is-customer-happy-screen.png "Details screen for this model")

![More details page for this model](media/is-customer-happy-screen2.png "More details screen for this model")

After the model is retrained, Bob sees that the grade hasn‚Äôt changed but the
percentage accuracy increased just on the cusp to be elevated to B. Liking the
results, Bob clicks *Publish*.

Once published, Bob will incorporate the new **Is Happy Customer** prediction
fields added to the *Account Dimension* in his [Customer Satisfaction canvas
application](#powerapp-canvas-application-aib-customer-satisfaction).

### Model enhancement considerations

For your business, consider including other customer related entities from
different areas of the business such as:

* Customer Service that addresses the day-to-day challenges customers face with your products or services.
* Sales that engage customers in pre- or post-sales activities
* Usage that tracks customer‚Äôs usage activity
* Product Diagnostics that identify and log outages or lower than expected  services. This is not a direct link to your customers but can serve as an indirect link that can predict an effect due to unplanned and undesired events.

## Power App canvas application ‚Äì AI Builder customer satisfaction

With a published model, *Is Happy Customer*, Bob will be able to incorporate the
model in a PowerApp Canvas application to view the results from the prediction
and dive into specific customer details.

The following image shows the *Customer Satisfaction* canvas application
that list all customers along with the **Is Happy Customer**, **Is Happy
Customer ‚Äì Predicted**, and **Is Happy Customer ‚Äì Probability** field values. As
the image illustrates, customer Ira Kirk is a happy customer yet there are no
values for **Is Happy Customer ‚Äì Predicted** and **Is Happy Customer ‚Äì
Probability**. This is because Ira provided Customer Feedback and therefore his
**Is Happy Customer** value was calculated through sentiment analysis and since
his happiness is assigned and was used as input to train the model, he would not
have a predicted value. Whereas Cleo Waller whose **Is Happy Customer** value is
*Not Determined* shows values of Yes and 0.96 for **Is Happy Customer ‚Äì
Predicted** and **Is Happy Customer ‚Äì Probability** respectfully. That is, the
model predicted Cleo as Happy.

Bob added links that allow him to dive deeper into any of the customers to see
additional customer details in any of the related entities.

### Guide to choosing features

The following are guidelines to assist field choice decisions.

Referring to the latest to [build a prediction model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/prediction-create-model), use the following guidelines to choose the input fields when creating a prediction.

Do choose:

* Metric fields

    * Quickens the training that a featurizer would most likely create

* Fields that best influence the prediction

    * Initially this is not apparent but becomes evident after repeated
        training experiments

Do not choose:

* Fields that are not available to predict in production

    * Causes overly optimistic if not completely invalid predictive models
        referred as Data Leakage. Bob, therefore, will not choose any fields
        from the Customer Feedback Rollup Fact entity.

* Fields that are highly correlated

    * While these may be eliminated during training, eliminating one of the
        pairs prior to training will reduce training cost and time

* Fields that are duplicates

    * These are also highly correlated fields

    * May exist in the same entity. For example, when a field is currency, a
        ‚Äúbase‚Äù field is created as well.

    * May exist across entities.
